# Stripe Warnings Resolution Guide

## Current Warnings and Solutions

### 1. Payment Method Types Not Activated

**Warning:**
```
[Stripe.js] The following payment method types are not activated:
- link
- cashapp
- amazon_pay
```

**Solution:**
1. Go to [Stripe Dashboard → Payment Methods](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods)
2. Enable the payment methods you want to support:
   - **Link**: Stripe's one-click payment method
   - **Cash App Pay**: For Cash App users
   - **Amazon Pay**: For Amazon customers
3. **Note**: These warnings are normal in test mode and won't affect functionality
4. **Important**: These payment methods require business verification and only work in live mode

### 2. Apple Pay Domain Verification

**Warning:**
```
[Stripe.js] You have not registered or verified the domain, so the following payment methods are not enabled in the Payment Element:
- apple_pay
```

**Solution:**
1. Go to [Stripe Dashboard → Apple Pay](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods)
2. Add your production domain (not localhost)
3. Download the verification file and place it on your domain
4. **Note**: This only works with live domains in production

### 3. Backend 500 Error Resolution

**Issue**: Payment confirmation fails with 500 error

**Root Cause**: Database connection timeouts, not GD extension issues

**Solution**:
```bash
# Clear and cache configuration
php artisan config:cache

# Check database connection
php artisan migrate:status

# If database issues persist, restart your database service
```

## Recommended Actions

### For Development (Test Mode):
1. **Ignore the payment method warnings** - they're expected in test mode
2. **Focus on core functionality** - basic card payments work fine

### For Production:
1. **Activate desired payment methods** in Stripe Dashboard
2. **Verify your domain** for Apple Pay
